### ORIGINAL CODE:

# The United Nations University’s World Income Inequality Database contains
# historical Gini coefficients for more than 170 countries — in some instances
# stretching back to the 1930s or ’40s. The latest version of the database was
# released in October 2015 and includes key details about each estimate, such as
# the name of the primary source and the quality of data collection.

# Divide into teams of three. Each of the five groups will take one section, and then
# everyone will regroup for a big class-wide challenge at the end.

### FINAL CLASS CHALLENGE (divide up how you like)
### Your challenge is to make two plots.

### 1) Make a barplot of the total number of veterans by state, sorted in order
### from most veterans to least (as an absolute number). For example, if California has 40 veterans
### and Illinois has 10 veterans, the barplot should have California before Illinois.
### Make sure you add a title to this plot with a proper x and y-axis labels.

### 2) Do the same as the above, but now make a barplot of proportional number of veterans
### in the population by state, sorted in order from highest percentage to lowest.
### Make sure you add a title to this plot with a proper x and y-axis labels.

### 3) Finally, search for and run the code that allows you to make two plots at once, so
### the two barplots can appear in the same view.

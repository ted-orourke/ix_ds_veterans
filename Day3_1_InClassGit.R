### ORIGINAL CODE:

# The United Nations University’s World Income Inequality Database contains
# historical Gini coefficients for more than 170 countries — in some instances
# stretching back to the 1930s or ’40s. The latest version of the database was
# released in October 2015 and includes key details about each estimate, such as
# the name of the primary source and the quality of data collection.

# Divide into teams of three. Each of the five groups will take one section, and then
# everyone will regroup for a big class-wide challenge at the end.

### SECTION 4: 
### Which state has the most HISPANIC race veterans? 
vetdata$State[vetdata$Hispanic.or.Latino..of.any.race. == max(vetdata$Hispanic.or.Latino..of.any.race.)]
#Texas

### The least? Which state has the closest value to the average?
# Vermont has the least, Washington is closest to average.
vetdata$State[vetdata$Hispanic.or.Latino..of.any.race. == min(vetdata$Hispanic.or.Latino..of.any.race.)]
avg_Hispanics <- mean(vetdata$Hispanic.or.Latino..of.any.race.)
vetdata$State[abs(vetdata$Hispanic.or.Latino..of.any.race. - avg_Hispanics) == min(abs(vetdata$Hispanic.or.Latino..of.any.race. - avg_Hispanics))]

### Which state has the greatest percentage of HISPANIC veterans?
#New Mexico has the greatest percentage of Hispanics
vetdata$State[vetdata$Hispanic.or.Latino..of.any.race./vetdata$Total == max(vetdata$Hispanic.or.Latino..of.any.race./vetdata$Total)]

### The lowest percentage? Which state has the closest value to the average percentage?
#West Virginia has the lowest percentage.  DC is the closest to the average percentage.
vetdata$State[vetdata$Hispanic.or.Latino..of.any.race./vetdata$Total == min(vetdata$Hispanic.or.Latino..of.any.race./vetdata$Total)]
avg_Percent <- mean(vetdata$Hispanic.or.Latino..of.any.race./vetdata$Total)
vetdata$State[abs(vetdata$Hispanic.or.Latino..of.any.race./vetdata$Total - avg_Percent) == min(abs(vetdata$Hispanic.or.Latino..of.any.race./vetdata$Total - avg_Percent))]

### FINAL CLASS CHALLENGE (divide up how you like)
### Your challenge is to make two plots.

### 1) Make a barplot of the total number of veterans by state, sorted in order
### from most veterans to least (as an absolute number). For example, if California has 40 veterans
### and Illinois has 10 veterans, the barplot should have California before Illinois.
### Make sure you add a title to this plot with a proper x and y-axis labels.

### 2) Do the same as the above, but now make a barplot of proportional number of veterans
### in the population by state, sorted in order from highest percentage to lowest.
### Make sure you add a title to this plot with a proper x and y-axis labels.

### 3) Finally, search for and run the code that allows you to make two plots at once, so
### the two barplots can appear in the same view.
